Flappy Bird - C++ Desktop Version
A C++ implementation of the classic mobile game Flappy Bird, offering a desktop version of the notoriously addictive and challenging game.

🎮 Gameplay and Mechanics
Players control a bird navigating through a series of randomly generated pipe gaps.

The goal is to avoid colliding with the pipes and prevent the bird from touching the ground.

Gameplay is simple yet demands quick reflexes and precise timing.

🕹️ Controls
The bird's flight is controlled by pressing the Spacebar or clicking the left mouse button, which causes it to flap its wings and ascend.

Releasing the key or button allows gravity to pull the bird downward, requiring strategic flaps to stay aloft and clear obstacles.
